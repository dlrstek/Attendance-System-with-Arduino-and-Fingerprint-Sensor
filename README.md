Developed an attendance system using Arduino and a fingerprint sensor. The project includes circuit design,
database creation with MySQL, a C# Windows Forms application for user interaction, and a custom-built
display case. The system speeds up attendance taking by using fingerprint identification and stores records in
a database for easy access and reporting.
